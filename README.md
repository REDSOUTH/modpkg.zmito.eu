# MODPKG Web

This repository contains the frontend web application for **MODPKG**, the universal platform to create, manage, and export Minecraft modpacks directly in your browser without any launcher lock-in.

Part of the **REDSOUTH Studio** ecosystem, MODPKG allows creators, server administrators, and players to build standalone modpacks with mods, resourcepacks, shaders, datapacks, and custom configuration overrides in seconds.

## Key Features

- **In-Browser Engine:** 100% client-side processing. All package management, JSON manifest generation, and ZIP compilation happen locally in the browser with zero vendor lock-in.
- **Zero Launcher Lock-In:** Packages exported from MODPKG can be deployed universally to Vanilla Minecraft clients, dedicated servers, or any third-party launcher.

  - **`.mpkg`**: Lightweight version index manifest containing metadata, dependencies, and direct download links.
  - **`.mpkg-proj`**: Complete project archive with version history, custom files, and configuration data for backup and sharing.
  - **`.mpkg.zip`**: Complete offline bundle with all JARs, resourcepacks, shaders, and configs pre-sorted into their respective folders (`/mods/`, `/resourcepacks/`, `/config/`).
- **Modrinth Conversion (`.mrpack`):** Direct import and automatic conversion of Modrinth modpack archives into MODPKG projects.
- **Integrated Code Editor:** Built-in Monaco Editor for viewing and editing configuration files (`.json`, `.toml`, `.yaml`, `.cfg`, scripts, text files) with a visual directory explorer.
- **Multimedia Asset Preview:** Built-in previewers for images, audio tracks, and video files embedded in overrides.
- **My Resources Library:** Global cross-project repository to store reusable configs and custom content across all your modpacks.
- **Collision Prevention & Clean Storage:** Automatic conflict handling with incremental IDs (`-2`, `-3`...) and atomic local storage clean-up.
